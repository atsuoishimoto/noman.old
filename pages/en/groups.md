# groups command

Display the groups a user belongs to.

## Overview

The `groups` command shows all the groups that a specified user is a member of. If no user is specified, it displays the groups for the current user. Groups are used in Unix/Linux systems to manage permissions and access control.

## Options

The `groups` command has very few options as it's a simple utility.

### **Default usage (current user)**

Shows groups for the currently logged-in user

```console
$ groups
staff admin wheel
```

### **Specific user**

Shows groups for a specified username

```console
$ groups username
username : staff admin
```

## Usage Examples

### Checking your own groups

```console
$ groups
user wheel admin staff
```

### Checking multiple users' groups

```console
$ groups root admin
root : wheel admin
admin : admin staff wheel
```

### Using with other commands

```console
$ echo "My groups are: $(groups)"
My groups are: user wheel admin staff
```

## Tips

### Understanding Group Membership

Group membership determines what files you can access and what system operations you can perform. The first group listed is typically your primary group.

### Checking Effective Groups

The `id` command provides more detailed information about user and group IDs, including the effective group ID: `id -g` shows your effective group ID.

### Group Files Location

Group definitions are stored in `/etc/group`. You can view this file with `cat /etc/group` to see all groups defined on the system.
