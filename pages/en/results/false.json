It's often used in shell scripts to force a failure condition or as a placeholder in conditional statements.\n\n## Options\n\nThe `false` command typically doesn't accept any options. It simply returns a non-zero exit status.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Basic usage\n\n```console\n$ false\n$ echo $?\n1\n```\n\n### Using in conditional statements\n\n```console\n$ if false; then echo \"This won't print\"; else echo \"This will print\"; fi\nThis will print\n```\n\n### Using in a loop\n\n```console\n$ while ! false; do echo \"This won't execute\"; done\n```\n\n### Using with logical operators\n\n```console\n$ false || echo \"This will execute because false failed\"\nThis will execute because false failed\n\n$ false && echo \"This won't execute because false failed\"\n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Testing Error Handling\n\nUse `false` to test error handling in scripts by forcing a command to fail.\n\n### Creating Infinite Loops\n\nThe command `while true; do ...; done` creates an infinite loop, while `while false; do ...; done` won't execute at all.\n\n### Logical Negation\n\n`! false` evaluates to true, which can be useful in conditional logic.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What's the difference between `false` and `true`?\nA. `false` returns an exit status of 1 (failure), while `true` returns 0 (success).\n\n#### Q2. Does `false` do anything besides return an exit status?\nA. No, it's designed to do nothing except return a non-zero exit status.\n\n#### Q3. Why would I use `false` in a script?\nA. It's useful for testing error conditions, creating conditional logic, or as a placeholder when you need a command that always fails.\n\n#### Q4. Can I change the exit status of `false`?\nA. No, `false` is designed to always return 1. If you need a different exit status, you can use `exit N` in a shell script.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/false-invocation.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
