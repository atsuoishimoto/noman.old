      "text": "# ping command\n\nSend ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts to verify connectivity.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `ping` command tests network connectivity by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request packets to a specified host and waiting for replies. It's commonly used to check if a host is reachable, measure round-trip time, and diagnose network issues.\n\n## Options\n\n### **-c count**\n\nStop after sending (and receiving) count ECHO_RESPONSE packets.\n\n```console\n$ ping -c 4 google.com\nPING google.com (142.250.190.78): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 142.250.190.78: icmp_seq=0 ttl=116 time=14.252 ms\n64 bytes from 142.250.190.78: icmp_seq=1 ttl=116 time=14.618 ms\n64 bytes from 142.250.190.78: icmp_seq=2 ttl=116 time=14.465 ms\n64 bytes from 142.250.190.78: icmp_seq=3 ttl=116 time=14.361 ms\n\n--- google.com ping statistics ---\n4 packets transmitted, 4 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 14.252/14.424/14.618/0.135 ms\n```\n\n### **-i interval**\n\nWait interval seconds between sending each packet. The default is to wait for one second between each packet.\n\n```console\n$ ping -i 2 -c 3 example.com\nPING example.com (93.184.216.34): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=0 ttl=56 time=11.632 ms\n64 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=1 ttl=56 time=11.726 ms\n64 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=2 ttl=56 time=11.978 ms\n\n--- example.com ping statistics ---\n3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 11.632/11.779/11.978/0.146 ms\n```\n\n### **-t ttl**\n\nSet the IP Time to Live (TTL) for outgoing packets.\n\n```console\n$ ping -t 64 -c 2 github.com\nPING github.com (140.82.121.3): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 140.82.121.3: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=15.361 ms\n64 bytes from 140.82.121.3: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=15.244 ms\n\n--- github.com ping statistics ---\n2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 15.244/15.303/15.361/0.059 ms\n```\n\n### **-s packetsize**\n\nSpecify the number of data bytes to be sent. The default is 56, which translates into 64 ICMP data bytes when combined with the 8 bytes of ICMP header data.\n\n```console\n$ ping -s 100 -c 2 example.com\nPING example.com (93.184.216.34): 100 data bytes\n108 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=0 ttl=56 time=11.632 ms\n108 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=1 ttl=56 time=11.726 ms\n\n--- example.com ping statistics ---\n2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 11.632/11.679/11.726/0.047 ms\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Basic connectivity test\n\n```console\n$ ping google.com\nPING google.com (142.250.190.78): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 142.250.190.78: icmp_seq=0 ttl=116 time=14.252 ms\n64 bytes from 142.250.190.78: icmp_seq=1 ttl=116 time=14.618 ms\n^C\n--- google.com ping statistics ---\n2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 14.252/14.435/14.618/0.183 ms\n```\n\n### Pinging with IP address\n\n```console\n$ ping -c 3 8.8.8.8\nPING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): 56 data bytes\n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=0 ttl=116 time=12.252 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=116 time=12.618 ms\n64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=116 time=12.465 ms\n\n--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---\n3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 12.252/12.445/12.618/0.150 ms\n```\n\n### Continuous ping with timestamp\n\n```console\n$ ping -D example.com\nPING example.com (93.184.216.34): 56 data bytes\n[1715011234.123456] 64 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=0 ttl=56 time=11.632 ms\n[1715011235.125678] 64 bytes from 93.184.216.34: icmp_seq=1 ttl=56 time=11.726 ms\n^C\n--- example.com ping statistics ---\n2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0.0% packet loss\nround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 11.632/11.679/11.726/0.047 ms\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n### Terminate Ping Gracefully\n\nPress Ctrl+C to stop a running ping command. This will display a summary of the ping statistics.\n\n### Check Network Latency\n\nPay attention to the \"time\" value in ping responses. Higher values indicate greater latency, which can affect real-time applications like video calls or online gaming.\n\n### Interpret Packet Loss\n\nAny packet loss (shown in the statistics) indicates network issues. Occasional packet loss (1-2%) may be normal, but consistent or high packet loss suggests network problems.\n\n### Use Ping for Troubleshooting\n\nIf you can't ping a host, try pinging intermediate devices or known working hosts to isolate where the connectivity issue might be occurring.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What does \"Request timeout\" mean?\nA. It means the target host didn't respond within the expected time. This could indicate network congestion, firewall blocks, or that the host is offline.\n\n#### Q2. Why does ping sometimes work with IP addresses but not with domain names?\nA. This usually indicates a DNS resolution problem. Your network can reach the IP address directly, but can't translate the domain name to an IP address.\n\n#### Q3. Can ping tell me if a specific port is open?\nA. No, ping only tests basic IP connectivity using ICMP. To test if a specific port is open, use tools like `telnet` or `nc` (netcat).\n\n#### Q4. Why might ping be blocked?\nA. Many networks and servers block ICMP packets for security reasons. A failed ping doesn't necessarily mean the host is down.\n\n## macOS Considerations\n\nOn macOS, you may need to run ping with sudo to use certain options like changing the interval to less than 1 second. Also, some options available in Linux versions of ping may not be available or may have different syntax in macOS.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://man.openbsd.org/ping.8\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
