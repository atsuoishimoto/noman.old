It's a simple utility that helps identify which user account is currently being used in the terminal session, which is particularly useful in scripts or when switching between different user accounts.\n\n## Options\n\nThe `whoami` command has very few options as it performs a single, straightforward function.\n\n### **--help**\n\nDisplay help information and exit.\n\n```console\n$ whoami --help\nUsage: whoami [OPTION]...\nPrint the user name associated with the current effective user ID.\nSame as id -un.\n\n      --help     display this help and exit\n      --version  output version information and exit\n\nGNU coreutils online help: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>\nReport whoami translation bugs to <https://translationproject.org/team/>\n```\n\n### **--version**\n\nOutput version information and exit.\n\n```console\n$ whoami --version\nwhoami (GNU coreutils) 8.32\nCopyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\nWritten by Richard Mlynarik.\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Basic usage\n\n```console\n$ whoami\njohn\n```\n\n### Using in a script to check current user\n\n```console\n$ echo \"Current user is $(whoami)\"\nCurrent user is john\n```\n\n### Using after switching users with sudo\n\n```console\n$ whoami\njohn\n$ sudo whoami\nroot\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n### Difference from `id` command\n\nThe `whoami` command is equivalent to `id -un`. The `id` command provides more comprehensive user identity information, while `whoami` focuses only on the username.\n\n### Use in shell scripts\n\n`whoami` is particularly useful in shell scripts to check which user is running the script, allowing for conditional execution based on user identity.\n\n### Root user verification\n\nUse `whoami` to verify if you're currently operating with root privileges after using commands like `sudo` or `su`.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What's the difference between `whoami` and `who am i`?\nA. `whoami` shows the effective username (who you are currently running as), while `who am i` (or `who -m`) shows the original login name, which might be different if you've used `su` or `sudo`.\n\n#### Q2. Can `whoami` show information about other users?\nA. No, `whoami` only displays information about the current effective user. To get information about other users, use commands like `id username` or `finger username`.\n\n#### Q3. Does `whoami` work the same on all Unix/Linux systems?\nA. Yes, `whoami` is a standard command with consistent behavior across Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS.\n\n#### Q4. Why would I use `whoami` instead of `echo $USER`?\nA. `whoami` shows the effective user (who you're running as), while `$USER` shows the login user. They differ when you use `sudo` or `su` to change users.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/whoami-invocation.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
