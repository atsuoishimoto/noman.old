It's essentially a combination of `git fetch` followed by `git merge` or `git rebase`, depending on configuration. This command is commonly used to update your local repository with changes made by others.\n\n## Options\n\n### **--all**\n\nFetch all remotes.\n\n```console\n$ git pull --all\nFetching origin\nUpdating 3e4f123..8a9b012\nFast-forward\n README.md | 5 +++++\n 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)\n```\n\n### **-r, --rebase[=false|true|merges|interactive]**\n\nRebase the current branch on top of the upstream branch after fetching, instead of merging.\n\n```console\n$ git pull --rebase\nSuccessfully rebased and updated refs/heads/main.\n```\n\n### **-v, --verbose**\n\nBe more verbose.\n\n```console\n$ git pull -v\nFrom https://github.com/user/repo\n * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD\nUpdating 3e4f123..8a9b012\nFast-forward\n README.md | 5 +++++\n 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)\n```\n\n### **--ff, --no-ff**\n\nWhen the merge resolves as a fast-forward, only update the branch pointer, without creating a merge commit. With --no-ff create a merge commit even when the merge resolves as a fast-forward.\n\n```console\n$ git pull --no-ff\nFrom https://github.com/user/repo\n * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD\nMerge made by the 'recursive' strategy.\n README.md | 5 +++++\n 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)\n```\n\n### **--ff-only**\n\nOnly fast-forward if possible. If not, exit with a non-zero status.\n\n```console\n$ git pull --ff-only\nfatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.\n```\n\n### **-q, --quiet**\n\nBe quiet. Only report errors.\n\n```console\n$ git pull -q\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Basic pull from origin\n\n```console\n$ git pull\nFrom https://github.com/user/repo\n * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD\nUpdating 3e4f123..8a9b012\nFast-forward\n README.md | 5 +++++\n 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)\n```\n\n### Pull from a specific remote and branch\n\n```console\n$ git pull upstream feature-branch\nFrom https://github.com/upstream/repo\n * branch            feature-branch -> FETCH_HEAD\nUpdating 3e4f123..8a9b012\nFast-forward\n feature.js | 15 +++++++++++++++\n 1 file changed, 15 insertions(+)\n```\n\n### Pull with rebase instead of merge\n\n```console\n$ git pull --rebase origin main\nFrom https://github.com/user/repo\n * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD\nSuccessfully rebased and updated refs/heads/main.\n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Always commit or stash changes before pulling\n\nMake sure your working directory is clean before running `git pull` to avoid conflicts with uncommitted changes.\n\n### Use `--rebase` for cleaner history\n\nUsing `git pull --rebase` creates a linear history without merge commits, which can make the commit history easier to follow.\n\n### Configure default pull behavior\n\nYou can set your default pull strategy with:\n```console\n$ git config --global pull.rebase true  # For rebase\n$ git config --global pull.ff only      # For fast-forward only\n```\n\n### Check what will be pulled first\n\nUse `git fetch` followed by `git log HEAD..origin/main` to see what changes will be pulled before actually pulling them.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What's the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?\nA. `git fetch` only downloads new data from a remote repository but doesn't integrate changes into your working files. `git pull` does both: it fetches and then automatically merges or rebases.\n\n#### Q2. How do I undo a git pull?\nA. You can use `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD` to undo the last pull and reset your branch to where it was before pulling.\n\n#### Q3. Why am I getting merge conflicts when pulling?\nA. Conflicts occur when the same part of a file has been modified both remotely and locally. You need to resolve these conflicts manually by editing the conflicted files.\n\n#### Q4. How can I pull without merging?\nA. Use `git fetch` instead of `git pull` to download changes without merging them.\n\n#### Q5. What does \"fast-forward\" mean in git pull?\nA. A fast-forward merge happens when the current branch's pointer can simply be moved forward to point to the incoming commit, without needing to create a merge commit.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
