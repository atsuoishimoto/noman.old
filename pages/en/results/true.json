It's primarily used in shell scripts for creating infinite loops, as a placeholder, or for testing conditional logic.\n\n## Options\n\nThe `true` command doesn't have any options as its sole purpose is to exit with a success status code.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Basic usage\n\n```console\n$ true\n$ echo $?\n0\n```\n\n### Creating an infinite loop in a shell script\n\n```console\n$ while true; do echo \"Press Ctrl+C to exit\"; sleep 1; done\nPress Ctrl+C to exit\nPress Ctrl+C to exit\nPress Ctrl+C to exit\n^C\n```\n\n### Using as a placeholder in conditional statements\n\n```console\n$ if [ \"$DEBUG\" = \"yes\" ]; then echo \"Debugging info\"; else true; fi\n```\n\n### Using in a logical OR operation\n\n```console\n$ true || echo \"This won't be printed\"\n$ false || echo \"This will be printed\"\nThis will be printed\n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Difference Between `true` and `:`\n\nBoth `true` and `:` (colon) commands do essentially the same thing - they return a successful exit status. The colon is a shell builtin that's slightly more efficient, but `true` is more readable and explicit.\n\n### Use in Conditional Execution\n\n`true` is useful in conditional execution with `&&` and `||` operators. For example, `command && true` ensures the overall command succeeds regardless of whether the first command succeeds.\n\n### Creating Empty Files\n\nWhile not its primary purpose, `true > filename` can be used to create an empty file (similar to `touch`).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What's the difference between `true` and `false` commands?\nA. `true` always exits with status code 0 (success), while `false` always exits with status code 1 (failure).\n\n#### Q2. Is `true` a shell builtin or an external command?\nA. Most shells implement `true` as a builtin for efficiency, but there's also an external `/bin/true` command that does the same thing.\n\n#### Q3. Why would I use `true` instead of just a comment?\nA. Unlike comments, `true` is an actual command that executes, making it useful in places where syntax requires a command, like in loop constructs or as a placeholder in conditional branches.\n\n#### Q4. Can `true` be used to suppress errors?\nA. Yes, `command || true` will ensure the overall command returns success even if the first command fails.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/true-invocation.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
