By default, it sends the TERM signal, which requests the process to terminate. Unlike the `kill` command which requires process IDs, `killall` allows you to specify process names, making it easier to terminate multiple related processes at once.\n\n## Options\n\n### **-e, --exact**\n\nRequire an exact match for very long names. If a command name is longer than 15 characters, the full name might be unavailable, and `killall` normally kills everything that matches within the first 15 characters. With this option, such entries are skipped.\n\n```console\n$ killall -e long_running_process_name\n```\n\n### **-I, --ignore-case**\n\nDo case insensitive process name match.\n\n```console\n$ killall -I firefox\n```\n\n### **-i, --interactive**\n\nAsk for confirmation before killing each process.\n\n```console\n$ killall -i chrome\nKill chrome(1234) ? (y/N) y\nKill chrome(5678) ? (y/N) n\n```\n\n### **-l, --list**\n\nList all known signal names.\n\n```console\n$ killall -l\nHUP INT QUIT ILL TRAP ABRT BUS FPE KILL USR1 SEGV USR2 PIPE ALRM TERM STKFLT CHLD CONT STOP TSTP TTIN TTOU URG XCPU XFSZ VTALRM PROF WINCH POLL PWR SYS\n```\n\n### **-q, --quiet**\n\nDo not complain if no processes were killed.\n\n```console\n$ killall -q nonexistent_process\n```\n\n### **-r, --regexp**\n\nInterpret process names as extended regular expressions.\n\n```console\n$ killall -r 'fire.*'\n```\n\n### **-s, --signal SIGNAL, -SIGNAL**\n\nSend a specific signal instead of TERM. The signal can be specified by name or number.\n\n```console\n$ killall -s KILL firefox\n$ killall -9 firefox    # Same as above, using signal number\n```\n\n### **-u, --user USER**\n\nKill only processes owned by the specified user.\n\n```console\n$ killall -u username firefox\n```\n\n### **-v, --verbose**\n\nReport if the signal was successfully sent.\n\n```console\n$ killall -v firefox\nKilled firefox(1234) with signal 15\n```\n\n### **-w, --wait**\n\nWait for all killed processes to die. Killall checks once per second if any of the killed processes still exist and only returns if none are left.\n\n```console\n$ killall -w firefox\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Killing all instances of a specific application\n\n```console\n$ killall firefox\n```\n\n### Forcefully terminating a process\n\n```console\n$ killall -9 chrome\n```\n\n### Killing processes owned by a specific user\n\n```console\n$ killall -u john java\n```\n\n### Killing processes with confirmation\n\n```console\n$ killall -i node\nKill node(1234) ? (y/N) y\nKill node(5678) ? (y/N) n\n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Use Confirmation for Important Systems\n\nWhen terminating processes on production systems, use the `-i` (interactive) flag to confirm each termination, preventing accidental shutdowns of critical services.\n\n### Force Kill with Caution\n\nThe `-9` (KILL) signal should be used as a last resort since it doesn't allow processes to clean up resources, potentially causing data corruption or orphaned temporary files.\n\n### Verify Before Killing\n\nUse `ps aux | grep [process_name]` before running killall to verify which processes will be affected, especially when using pattern matching.\n\n### Wait for Completion\n\nUse the `-w` flag when you need to ensure processes are fully terminated before starting new ones, particularly useful in scripts.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What's the difference between `kill` and `killall`?\nA. `kill` terminates processes by their process ID (PID), while `killall` terminates processes by their name, allowing you to kill multiple instances at once.\n\n#### Q2. How do I forcefully terminate a process?\nA. Use `killall -9 process_name` or `killall -s KILL process_name` to send the SIGKILL signal, which cannot be caught or ignored by the process.\n\n#### Q3. Why didn't `killall` terminate my process?\nA. This could happen if you don't have permission to kill the process (try using sudo), if the process name is misspelled, or if the process is in an uninterruptible state.\n\n#### Q4. Is `killall` safe to use?\nA. Generally yes, but be careful on some Unix systems (like Solaris) where `killall` might kill ALL processes, potentially shutting down the system. On Linux and macOS, it only kills processes matching the specified name.\n\n## macOS Considerations\n\nOn macOS, `killall` behaves similarly to Linux but has fewer options. The `-e`, `-r`, and some other options may not be available. Also, macOS's `killall` doesn't support the `-w` (wait) option. Always check the available options with `man killall` on your specific system.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/killall.1.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
