By default, it doesn't remove directories and doesn't prompt for confirmation before removing files. Once files are deleted with `rm`, they cannot be easily recovered, so use this command with caution.\n\n## Options\n\n### **-f, --force**\n\nIgnore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt for confirmation\n\n```console\n$ rm -f nonexistent_file.txt\n$\n```\n\n### **-i, --interactive**\n\nPrompt before every removal\n\n```console\n$ rm -i important.txt\nrm: remove regular file 'important.txt'? y\n$\n```\n\n### **-r, -R, --recursive**\n\nRemove directories and their contents recursively\n\n```console\n$ rm -r project_folder/\n$\n```\n\n### **-d, --dir**\n\nRemove empty directories\n\n```console\n$ rm -d empty_directory/\n$\n```\n\n### **-v, --verbose**\n\nExplain what is being done\n\n```console\n$ rm -v file.txt\nremoved 'file.txt'\n$\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Removing multiple files\n\n```console\n$ rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt\n$\n```\n\n### Removing files with confirmation\n\n```console\n$ rm -i *.txt\nrm: remove regular file 'document.txt'? y\nrm: remove regular file 'notes.txt'? n\n$\n```\n\n### Removing directories and their contents\n\n```console\n$ rm -rf old_project/\n$\n```\n\n### Removing files with verbose output\n\n```console\n$ rm -v *.log\nremoved 'error.log'\nremoved 'access.log'\nremoved 'system.log'\n$\n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Use with Caution\n\nThe `rm` command permanently deletes files without moving them to a trash or recycle bin. Always double-check what you're deleting, especially when using wildcards.\n\n### Safer Deletion with Interactive Mode\n\nWhen deleting multiple files, use `rm -i` to confirm each deletion. This helps prevent accidental removal of important files.\n\n### Avoid `rm -rf /`\n\nNever run `rm -rf /` or `rm -rf /*` as these commands will attempt to delete everything on your system, potentially rendering it unusable.\n\n### Use Aliases for Safety\n\nConsider creating an alias in your shell configuration: `alias rm='rm -i'` to always use interactive mode by default.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. Can I recover files deleted with `rm`?\nA. Generally no. Unlike graphical file managers, `rm` doesn't move files to a trash folder. Recovery requires specialized tools and isn't guaranteed.\n\n#### Q2. How do I remove files with special characters in their names?\nA. Use quotes around the filename or escape the special characters with a backslash. For example: `rm \"file with spaces.txt\"` or `rm file\\ with\\ spaces.txt`.\n\n#### Q3. How can I safely remove a directory and all its contents?\nA. Use `rm -r directory/` to recursively remove a directory and its contents. Add `-i` for confirmation prompts.\n\n#### Q4. What's the difference between `rm -r` and `rmdir`?\nA. `rmdir` only removes empty directories, while `rm -r` removes directories and all their contents recursively.\n\n## macOS Considerations\n\nOn macOS, the default `rm` command doesn't support the `--one-file-system` option available in GNU rm. Also, to completely bypass the macOS Trash when deleting files from external drives, you must use `rm` rather than the Finder's delete function.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/rm-invocation.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
