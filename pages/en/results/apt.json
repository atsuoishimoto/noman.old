To allow upgrades again, use `sudo apt-mark unhold package_name`.\n\n### Check for broken dependencies\n\nUse `sudo apt --fix-broken install` to fix broken dependencies that might occur after failed installations.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What's the difference between apt and apt-get?\nA. `apt` is a newer, more user-friendly command that combines the most commonly used features of `apt-get` and `apt-cache` with improved output formatting and progress information.\n\n#### Q2. How do I fix \"Could not get lock\" errors?\nA. This usually means another package manager is running. Wait for it to finish or check for stuck processes with `ps aux | grep apt` and kill them if necessary with `sudo kill <process_id>`.\n\n#### Q3. How can I install a package without being prompted?\nA. Use the `-y` flag: `sudo apt install -y package_name` to automatically answer \"yes\" to prompts.\n\n#### Q4. How do I update only security packages?\nA. Use `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -s` to simulate an upgrade, then `sudo apt install package_name` for specific security packages you want to update.\n\n#### Q5. How do I downgrade a package?\nA. Use `sudo apt install package_name=version_number` to install a specific older version.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man8/apt.8.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
