# noman â€“ AI-powered, human-friendly man pages

**Noman** is a command-line tool and website that offers simplified, AI-generated man pages for Unix commands.  
Traditional `man` pages are thorough but often hard to digestâ€”especially for beginners or those who need quick, practical help.  
Noman fixes that by generating concise, example-rich documentation that's easy to read, color-formatted for terminal use, and instantly available.

## ðŸš€ Features

### AI-Generated, Pre-Generated  
Pages are generated using carefully designed AI prompts, then saved as static filesâ€”making them load instantly like regular man pages.

### Focused on Practical Usage  
Noman highlights the most common and useful command options, omitting obscure flags and overly technical details irrelevant to daily tasks.

### Simplified Language  
All documentation is written in clear, plain Language. No jargon or dense syntaxâ€”just what you need, explained simply.

### Real-World Examples  
Each command includes real-world use cases that reflect how developers and sysadmins actually use these tools.

### FAQs and Pitfalls  
Frequently asked questions and common mistakes are addressed directly on each command page, saving users from trial-and-error.

### Clean CLI Output with Markdown Formatting and Colors  
Command-line output is structured with lightweight Markdown and ANSI colors, improving readability in the terminal.  
Headings, code blocks, and options are visually distinct and easy to scan.

### Instant Results â€“ No Waiting, No Typing Questions

Just type `noman ls` and get a clean, helpful answer instantly.

## ðŸ’¡ Why AI Works Well Here

Unlike open-ended queries, Unix commands are stable, well-documented, and deterministicâ€”ideal for AI summarization.  
By using custom prompts per command, Noman ensures clarity, consistency, and minimal hallucination.  
The result: reliable AI-generated documentation without guesswork.

## ðŸ”’ Safer Than Searching

General-purpose AIs and web search often return inconsistent, outdated, or poorly structured results depending on query phrasing.  
Noman avoids that by pre-generating all pages with verified prompts and consistent formatting.  
It's a safer, faster, and more beginner-friendly way to learn command-line tools.
