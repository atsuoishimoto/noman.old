This enables passwordless SSH logins to the remote server, eliminating the need to enter your password each time you connect. It's a simple way to set up key-based authentication, which is both more convenient and more secure than password authentication.\n\n## Options\n\n### **-i [identity_file]**\n\nSpecifies the identity file (private key) to use. By default, it uses `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.\n\n```console\n$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/custom_key.pub user@remote-host\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\nuser@remote-host's password: \n\nNumber of key(s) added: 1\n\nNow try logging into the machine, with:   \"ssh 'user@remote-host'\"\nand check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\n```\n\n### **-f**\n\nForces the installation, even if the key already exists on the remote server.\n\n```console\n$ ssh-copy-id -f user@remote-host\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\nuser@remote-host's password: \n\nNumber of key(s) added: 1\n\nNow try logging into the machine, with:   \"ssh 'user@remote-host'\"\nand check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\n```\n\n### **-n**\n\nDry run mode - shows what keys would be installed without actually installing them.\n\n```console\n$ ssh-copy-id -n user@remote-host\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: \"/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\"\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\nWould have added the following key(s):\nssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA...truncated...user@local-host\n```\n\n### **-p [port]**\n\nSpecifies the port to connect to on the remote host.\n\n```console\n$ ssh-copy-id -p 2222 user@remote-host\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\nuser@remote-host's password: \n\nNumber of key(s) added: 1\n\nNow try logging into the machine, with:   \"ssh -p 2222 'user@remote-host'\"\nand check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```console\n$ ssh-copy-id user@remote-host\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\nuser@remote-host's password: \n\nNumber of key(s) added: 1\n\nNow try logging into the machine, with:   \"ssh 'user@remote-host'\"\nand check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\n```\n\n### Using a Specific Identity File\n\n```console\n$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@remote-host\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\nuser@remote-host's password: \n\nNumber of key(s) added: 1\n\nNow try logging into the machine, with:   \"ssh 'user@remote-host'\"\nand check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\n```\n\n### Connecting to a Non-Standard Port\n\n```console\n$ ssh-copy-id -p 2222 user@remote-host\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed\n/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys\nuser@remote-host's password: \n\nNumber of key(s) added: 1\n\nNow try logging into the machine, with:   \"ssh -p 2222 'user@remote-host'\"\nand check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n### Generate SSH Keys First\n\nBefore using `ssh-copy-id`, make sure you have SSH keys generated. If not, create them with:\n\n```console\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096\n```\n\n### Verify Key Installation\n\nAfter running `ssh-copy-id`, verify that passwordless login works by attempting to SSH into the remote server:\n\n```console\n$ ssh user@remote-host\n```\n\n### Multiple Keys\n\nIf you have multiple SSH keys, specify which one to use with the `-i` option. This is useful when you use different keys for different servers.\n\n### Remote Directory Structure\n\n`ssh-copy-id` will create the `~/.ssh` directory and `authorized_keys` file on the remote server if they don't exist, with appropriate permissions.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What if I don't have an SSH key yet?\nA. Generate an SSH key pair first using `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` or `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`, then use `ssh-copy-id`.\n\n#### Q2. Can I use `ssh-copy-id` with a custom SSH port?\nA. Yes, use the `-p` option: `ssh-copy-id -p 2222 user@remote-host`.\n\n#### Q3. How do I know if my key was successfully installed?\nA. After running `ssh-copy-id`, try logging in with `ssh user@remote-host`. If you're not prompted for a password, the key was successfully installed.\n\n#### Q4. Can I copy multiple keys at once?\nA. Yes, `ssh-copy-id` will copy all public keys found in your `~/.ssh` directory by default. To specify a particular key, use the `-i` option.\n\n#### Q5. What if the remote server doesn't have the `.ssh` directory?\nA. `ssh-copy-id` will create the directory and set appropriate permissions automatically.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://man.openbsd.org/ssh-copy-id\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
