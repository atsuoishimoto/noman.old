It provides a way to grant limited root privileges to users listed in the `/etc/sudoers` file without sharing the root password.\n\n## Options\n\n### **-b, --background**\n\nRun the command in the background.\n\n```console\n$ sudo -b apt update\n[1] 12345\n```\n\n### **-u, --user**\n\nRun the command as a user other than the default target user (root).\n\n```console\n$ sudo -u postgres psql\npsql (14.5)\nType \"help\" for help.\n\npostgres=#\n```\n\n### **-s, --shell**\n\nRun the shell specified in the user's password database entry as a login shell.\n\n```console\n$ sudo -s\nroot@hostname:~#\n```\n\n### **-i, --login**\n\nRun the shell specified in the target user's password database entry as a login shell.\n\n```console\n$ sudo -i\nroot@hostname:~#\n```\n\n### **-k, --reset-timestamp**\n\nInvalidate the user's cached credentials.\n\n```console\n$ sudo -k\n[sudo] password for user:\n```\n\n### **-v, --validate**\n\nUpdate the user's cached credentials, extending the timeout.\n\n```console\n$ sudo -v\n[sudo] password for user:\n```\n\n### **-l, --list**\n\nList the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the current user.\n\n```console\n$ sudo -l\nUser user may run the following commands on hostname:\n    (ALL : ALL) ALL\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Installing software with elevated privileges\n\n```console\n$ sudo apt install nginx\n[sudo] password for user: \nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree... Done\n...\n```\n\n### Editing a system configuration file\n\n```console\n$ sudo nano /etc/hosts\n[sudo] password for user:\n```\n\n### Running a command as a different user\n\n```console\n$ sudo -u www-data php /var/www/html/script.php\n[sudo] password for user:\nScript output...\n```\n\n### Getting a root shell\n\n```console\n$ sudo -i\n[sudo] password for user:\nroot@hostname:~#\n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Use `sudo !!` to Repeat the Previous Command with sudo\n\nIf you forget to use sudo for a command that requires it, type `sudo !!` to repeat the previous command with sudo privileges.\n\n### Configure sudo Without Password\n\nEdit the sudoers file with `sudo visudo` and add a line like `username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` to allow a user to run sudo commands without entering a password.\n\n### Use `sudo -E` to Preserve Environment Variables\n\nWhen you need to run a command with sudo but keep your current environment variables, use the `-E` flag.\n\n### Understand the Security Implications\n\nOnly grant sudo access to trusted users, and be careful about which commands they're allowed to run. A user with unrestricted sudo access effectively has full control of the system.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What's the difference between `sudo -s` and `sudo -i`?\nA. `sudo -s` starts a shell with root privileges but keeps your current environment. `sudo -i` simulates a full login as root, with root's environment.\n\n#### Q2. How long does sudo authentication last?\nA. By default, sudo caches your credentials for 15 minutes. After that, you'll need to enter your password again.\n\n#### Q3. How can I edit the sudo configuration safely?\nA. Always use `sudo visudo` to edit the sudoers file. This command checks for syntax errors before saving, preventing you from locking yourself out.\n\n#### Q4. Can I see what commands other users have run with sudo?\nA. Yes, sudo logs all commands to the system log, typically in `/var/log/auth.log` or `/var/log/secure`.\n\n#### Q5. How do I run a command as root without being prompted for a password?\nA. You need to configure the sudoers file with NOPASSWD option for specific commands or all commands.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://www.sudo.ws/docs/man/sudo.man/\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
