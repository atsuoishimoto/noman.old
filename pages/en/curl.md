# curl command

Transfer data from or to a server using various protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more.

## Overview

`curl` is a command-line tool for transferring data with URLs. It supports numerous protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, and more. It's commonly used for downloading files, testing APIs, sending HTTP requests, and debugging network issues. `curl` is highly versatile and can be used with or without user interaction.

## Options

### **-I, --head**

Fetch HTTP headers only (HEAD request)

```console
$ curl -I https://example.com
HTTP/2 200 
content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
date: Tue, 30 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT

```

### **-X, --request \<method\>**

Specify the request method to use (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)

```console
$ curl -X POST https://api.example.com/data
{"status":"success","message":"Data received"}
```

### **-H, --header \<header\>**

Add custom headers to the request

```console
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" https://api.example.com
{"data":"This is protected content"}
```

### **-d, --data \<data\>**

Send data in the request body (typically for POST requests)

```console
$ curl -X POST -d "name=John&age=30" https://api.example.com/users
{"id":123,"name":"John","age":30}
```

### **-s, --silent**

Silent mode (don't show progress meter or error messages)

```console
$ curl -s https://example.com
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Domain</title>
    ...
</html>
```

## Usage Examples

### Downloading a file and showing progress

```console
$ curl -# -o firefox.dmg "https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest"
######################################################################## 100.0%
```

### Sending JSON data in a POST request

```console
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Alice","email":"alice@example.com"}' https://api.example.com/users
{"id":456,"name":"Alice","email":"alice@example.com","status":"created"}
```

### Following redirects

```console
$ curl -L http://github.com
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>GitHub: Let's build from here Â· GitHub</title>
    ...
```

### Uploading a file

```console
$ curl -F "file=@photo.jpg" https://upload.example.com
{"success":true,"url":"https://cdn.example.com/uploads/photo123.jpg"}
```

## Tips

### Use `-v` for Debugging

The verbose flag (`-v`) shows the complete request and response headers, which is invaluable for debugging API calls or network issues.

```console
$ curl -v https://example.com
```

### Save Cookies and Use Them Later

Use `--cookie-jar` to save cookies and `--cookie` to use them in subsequent requests, which helps with authenticated sessions.

```console
$ curl --cookie-jar cookies.txt https://login.example.com
$ curl --cookie cookies.txt https://protected.example.com
```

### Set Timeouts for Unreliable Connections

Use `--connect-timeout` and `--max-time` to prevent curl from hanging indefinitely on slow or unresponsive servers.

```console
$ curl --connect-timeout 10 --max-time 30 https://slow-server.example.com
```

### Use `-k` with Caution

The `-k` (or `--insecure`) option allows connections to SSL sites without certificates, but should only be used for testing as it bypasses security checks.
