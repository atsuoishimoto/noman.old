Unlike `rm`, it can only operate on one file at a time and doesn't accept options for recursive deletion or interactive prompting. It's a simple, focused command that performs the basic file deletion operation.\n\n## Options\n\n`unlink` is a simple command with minimal options:\n\n### **--help**\n\nDisplay help information and exit.\n\n```console\n$ unlink --help\nUsage: unlink FILE\n  or:  unlink OPTION\nCall the unlink function to remove the specified FILE.\n\n      --help     display this help and exit\n      --version  output version information and exit\n```\n\n### **--version**\n\nOutput version information and exit.\n\n```console\n$ unlink --version\nunlink (GNU coreutils) 8.32\nCopyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\nWritten by Michael Stone.\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Removing a file\n\n```console\n$ touch testfile.txt\n$ ls\ntestfile.txt\n$ unlink testfile.txt\n$ ls\n$\n```\n\n### Attempting to remove a directory (will fail)\n\n```console\n$ mkdir testdir\n$ unlink testdir\nunlink: cannot unlink 'testdir': Is a directory\n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Use `rm` for More Flexibility\n\nWhile `unlink` is useful for simple file deletion, `rm` provides more options like recursive deletion (`-r`), force deletion (`-f`), and interactive prompting (`-i`).\n\n### Symbolic Links\n\nWhen using `unlink` on a symbolic link, it removes the link itself, not the file it points to.\n\n### Error Handling\n\n`unlink` will fail with an error message if the file doesn't exist, is a directory, or if you don't have permission to remove it.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What's the difference between `unlink` and `rm`?\nA. `unlink` can only remove a single file and has no options for modifying its behavior. `rm` can remove multiple files, directories (with `-r`), and has various options for controlling how deletion works.\n\n#### Q2. Can `unlink` remove directories?\nA. No, `unlink` cannot remove directories. Use `rmdir` for empty directories or `rm -r` for directories with contents.\n\n#### Q3. What happens if I try to `unlink` a file that doesn't exist?\nA. `unlink` will display an error message stating that the file doesn't exist.\n\n#### Q4. Is there any way to recover a file after using `unlink`?\nA. Generally no. Once a file is unlinked, it's removed from the filesystem. Recovery might be possible with specialized tools, but it's not guaranteed.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/unlink-invocation.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
