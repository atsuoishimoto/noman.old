It allows system administrators to add and remove users from groups, set group administrators, and manage group passwords. The command modifies the `/etc/group` and `/etc/gshadow` files, which store group information on Linux systems.\n\n## Options\n\n### **-a, --add** *USER*\n\nAdds the specified user to the named group.\n\n```console\n$ sudo gpasswd -a john developers\nAdding user john to group developers\n```\n\n### **-d, --delete** *USER*\n\nRemoves the specified user from the named group.\n\n```console\n$ sudo gpasswd -d john developers\nRemoving user john from group developers\n```\n\n### **-A, --administrators** *USER1,USER2,...*\n\nSets the list of administrative users for the group. Only these users can add or remove members from the group.\n\n```console\n$ sudo gpasswd -A jane,mike developers\n```\n\n### **-M, --members** *USER1,USER2,...*\n\nSets the list of members for the group, replacing the current member list.\n\n```console\n$ sudo gpasswd -M alice,bob,charlie developers\n```\n\n### **-r, --remove-password**\n\nRemoves the password from the group.\n\n```console\n$ sudo gpasswd -r developers\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Adding a user to multiple groups\n\n```console\n$ sudo gpasswd -a user1 developers\nAdding user user1 to group developers\n$ sudo gpasswd -a user1 admins\nAdding user user1 to group admins\n```\n\n### Setting group administrators and members in one command\n\n```console\n$ sudo gpasswd -A admin1,admin2 -M user1,user2,user3 projectteam\n```\n\n### Setting a password for a group\n\n```console\n$ sudo gpasswd developers\nChanging the password for group developers\nNew Password: \nRe-enter new password: \n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Use Groups Command to Verify Changes\n\nAfter modifying group memberships with `gpasswd`, use the `groups` command to verify that the changes took effect:\n\n```console\n$ groups username\n```\n\n### Avoid Group Passwords When Possible\n\nGroup passwords are generally considered less secure than user-based access control. Modern systems typically rely on user permissions and sudo rather than group passwords.\n\n### Use Sudo with gpasswd\n\nMost `gpasswd` operations require root privileges. Always use `sudo` when executing `gpasswd` commands unless you're already logged in as root.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What's the difference between `gpasswd` and `usermod -G`?\nA. `gpasswd` is specifically designed for group management and can add/remove single users without affecting other group members. `usermod -G` replaces all of a user's supplementary groups at once, which can accidentally remove the user from other groups if not used carefully.\n\n#### Q2. How do I check which users are in a group?\nA. Use `getent group groupname` to see all members of a specific group.\n\n#### Q3. Can regular users use `gpasswd`?\nA. Regular users can only use `gpasswd` if they've been designated as administrators of the group using the `-A` option, and even then, they have limited capabilities compared to root.\n\n#### Q4. What happens if I set a group password?\nA. Setting a group password allows users to temporarily join the group using the `newgrp` command if they know the password. This is rarely used in modern systems.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://linux.die.net/man/1/gpasswd\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
