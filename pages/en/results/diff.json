It's commonly used to identify changes between file versions, create patches, or check what has been modified in a file.\n\n## Options\n\n### **-u, --unified**\n\nOutput differences in unified format, showing context around the changes.\n\n```console\n$ diff -u file1.txt file2.txt\n--- file1.txt\t2025-05-05 10:00:00.000000000 -0400\n+++ file2.txt\t2025-05-05 10:30:00.000000000 -0400\n@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@\n This is a test file.\n-It has some content.\n+It has some modified content.\n The end of the file.\n+A new line added.\n```\n\n### **-b, --ignore-space-change**\n\nIgnore changes in the amount of white space.\n\n```console\n$ diff -b file1.txt file2.txt\n2c2\n< It has some content.\n---\n> It has some   modified content.\n```\n\n### **-i, --ignore-case**\n\nIgnore case differences in file contents.\n\n```console\n$ diff -i uppercase.txt lowercase.txt\n[No output if files differ only in case]\n```\n\n### **-r, --recursive**\n\nRecursively compare any subdirectories found.\n\n```console\n$ diff -r dir1 dir2\ndiff -r dir1/file.txt dir2/file.txt\n2c2\n< This is in dir1\n---\n> This is in dir2\nOnly in dir2: newfile.txt\n```\n\n### **-N, --new-file**\n\nTreat absent files as empty.\n\n```console\n$ diff -N file1.txt nonexistent.txt\n1,3d0\n< This is a test file.\n< It has some content.\n< The end of the file.\n```\n\n### **-c, --context**\n\nOutput differences in context format with 3 lines of context.\n\n```console\n$ diff -c file1.txt file2.txt\n*** file1.txt\t2025-05-05 10:00:00.000000000 -0400\n--- file2.txt\t2025-05-05 10:30:00.000000000 -0400\n***************\n*** 1,3 ****\n  This is a test file.\n- It has some content.\n  The end of the file.\n--- 1,4 ----\n  This is a test file.\n+ It has some modified content.\n  The end of the file.\n+ A new line added.\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Comparing two files\n\n```console\n$ diff original.txt modified.txt\n2c2\n< This is the original line.\n---\n> This is the modified line.\n4d3\n< This line will be deleted.\n```\n\n### Creating a patch file\n\n```console\n$ diff -u original.txt modified.txt > changes.patch\n$ cat changes.patch\n--- original.txt\t2025-05-05 10:00:00.000000000 -0400\n+++ modified.txt\t2025-05-05 10:30:00.000000000 -0400\n@@ -1,4 +1,3 @@\n First line is unchanged.\n-This is the original line.\n+This is the modified line.\n Third line is unchanged.\n-This line will be deleted.\n```\n\n### Comparing directories\n\n```console\n$ diff -r dir1 dir2\nOnly in dir1: uniquefile1.txt\nOnly in dir2: uniquefile2.txt\ndiff -r dir1/common.txt dir2/common.txt\n1c1\n< This is in dir1\n---\n> This is in dir2\n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Understanding diff output\n\nThe standard diff output format uses line numbers and commands:\n- `a` (add): Lines added to the second file\n- `d` (delete): Lines deleted from the first file\n- `c` (change): Lines changed between files\n\n### Use color for better readability\n\nMany systems support colored diff output with `diff --color=auto` which makes changes easier to spot.\n\n### Combine with grep for specific changes\n\nUse `diff file1 file2 | grep pattern` to find only differences containing specific text.\n\n### Side-by-side comparison\n\nUse `diff -y` or `diff --side-by-side` to see differences in a two-column format, which can be easier to read for some changes.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What do the symbols in diff output mean?\nA. In standard output, `<` indicates lines from the first file, `>` indicates lines from the second file, and `---` separates changed sections.\n\n#### Q2. How do I create a patch file?\nA. Use `diff -u original.txt modified.txt > changes.patch` to create a unified format patch file.\n\n#### Q3. How can I ignore whitespace differences?\nA. Use `diff -b` to ignore changes in whitespace, or `diff -w` to ignore all whitespace.\n\n#### Q4. How do I apply a diff patch?\nA. Use the `patch` command: `patch original.txt < changes.patch`\n\n## References\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/diff-Options.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
