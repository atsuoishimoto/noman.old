These keys allow secure, password-less login to remote systems. The command can also manage existing keys, including changing passphrases and converting between key formats.\n\n## Options\n\n### **-t type**\n\nSpecifies the type of key to create (rsa, ed25519, dsa, ecdsa).\n\n```console\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519\nGenerating public/private ed25519 key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519): \nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): \nEnter same passphrase again: \nYour identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519\nYour public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n```\n\n### **-b bits**\n\nSpecifies the number of bits in the key (default depends on key type).\n\n```console\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): \n```\n\n### **-f filename**\n\nSpecifies the filename of the key file.\n\n```console\n$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/github_key\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): \n```\n\n### **-C comment**\n\nProvides a comment for the key, typically an email address or description.\n\n```console\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"user@example.com\"\nGenerating public/private ed25519 key pair.\n```\n\n### **-p**\n\nChanges the passphrase of an existing private key file.\n\n```console\n$ ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nEnter old passphrase: \nEnter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase): \nEnter same passphrase again: \nYour identification has been saved with the new passphrase.\n```\n\n### **-l**\n\nShows the fingerprint of a specified public or private key file.\n\n```console\n$ ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\n256 SHA256:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz1234567890abcdef user@example.com (ED25519)\n```\n\n### **-y**\n\nReads a private key file and outputs the public key.\n\n```console\n$ ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\nEnter passphrase: \n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Creating a default RSA key pair\n\n```console\n$ ssh-keygen\nGenerating public/private rsa key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa): \nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): \nEnter same passphrase again: \nYour identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa\nYour public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n```\n\n### Creating a key with custom settings\n\n```console\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"work laptop\" -f ~/.ssh/work_key\nGenerating public/private ed25519 key pair.\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): \nEnter same passphrase again: \nYour identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/work_key\nYour public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/work_key.pub\n```\n\n### Converting a key to a different format\n\n```console\n$ ssh-keygen -e -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > ~/.ssh/id_rsa_openssh.pub\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n### Choose the Right Key Type\n\nEd25519 keys are recommended for most users as they provide strong security with smaller key sizes. RSA keys with at least 3072 bits are also secure but larger.\n\n### Use a Strong Passphrase\n\nAdding a passphrase to your key provides an extra layer of security. If your private key is stolen, the passphrase prevents immediate use.\n\n### Back Up Your Keys\n\nAlways keep backups of your private keys in a secure location. If you lose your private key, you'll need to generate a new key pair and update all servers.\n\n### Key Location Matters\n\nBy default, SSH looks for keys in the ~/.ssh directory. Using non-standard locations requires specifying the key path with `-i` when using ssh.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. How do I copy my public key to a server?\nA. Use `ssh-copy-id user@hostname` to copy your public key to a remote server's authorized_keys file.\n\n#### Q2. What's the difference between RSA and Ed25519 keys?\nA. Ed25519 keys are newer, smaller, and generally faster than RSA keys while providing equivalent or better security.\n\n#### Q3. How do I generate a key without a passphrase?\nA. Simply press Enter when prompted for a passphrase during key generation.\n\n#### Q4. How can I change my key's passphrase?\nA. Use `ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` to change the passphrase of an existing key.\n\n#### Q5. What should I do if I forgot my key's passphrase?\nA. Unfortunately, there's no way to recover a lost passphrase. You'll need to generate a new key pair.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
