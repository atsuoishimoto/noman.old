It's used within shell scripts to control loop flow by immediately starting the next iteration when certain conditions are met.\n\n## Options\n\nThe `continue` command doesn't have options in the traditional sense, but it can accept an optional numeric argument.\n\n### **n** (numeric argument)\n\nSpecifies which enclosing loop to continue. By default (no argument), `continue` affects the innermost loop.\n\n```console\n$ for i in 1 2 3; do\n>   for j in a b c; do\n>     if [ $j = \"b\" ]; then\n>       continue 2  # Skip to next iteration of outer loop\n>     fi\n>     echo \"$i $j\"\n>   done\n> done\n1 a\n2 a\n3 a\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Basic Usage in a Loop\n\n```console\n$ for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do\n>   if [ $i -eq 3 ]; then\n>     continue\n>   fi\n>   echo \"Processing item $i\"\n> done\nProcessing item 1\nProcessing item 2\nProcessing item 4\nProcessing item 5\n```\n\n### Skipping Iterations Based on Conditions\n\n```console\n$ i=0\n$ while [ $i -lt 5 ]; do\n>   i=$((i+1))\n>   if [ $((i % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then\n>     continue\n>   fi\n>   echo \"Odd number: $i\"\n> done\nOdd number: 1\nOdd number: 3\nOdd number: 5\n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Use with Caution in Complex Loops\n\nWhen using `continue` in nested loops, be careful about which loop you're affecting. Without a numeric argument, it only affects the innermost loop.\n\n### Combine with Conditional Logic\n\n`continue` is most useful when combined with conditional statements to skip iterations that meet specific criteria, making your scripts more efficient.\n\n### Consider Readability\n\nWhile `continue` can make scripts more efficient, excessive use can make code harder to follow. Use it judiciously to maintain readability.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What's the difference between `continue` and `break`?\nA. `continue` skips to the next iteration of a loop, while `break` exits the loop entirely.\n\n#### Q2. Can I use `continue` outside of a loop?\nA. No, using `continue` outside a loop will result in an error as it only has meaning within loops.\n\n#### Q3. How do I continue a specific outer loop in nested loops?\nA. Use `continue n` where n is the level of the loop you want to continue (1 for the innermost loop, 2 for the next level out, etc.).\n\n#### Q4. Does `continue` work the same in all shell types?\nA. The basic functionality is consistent across bash, zsh, and other common shells, but there might be subtle differences in behavior with complex scripts.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
