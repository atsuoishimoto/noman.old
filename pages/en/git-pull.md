# git pull command

Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch.

## Overview

`git pull` is a command that updates your current local branch with changes from a remote repository. It combines two operations: `git fetch` (downloads remote changes) followed by `git merge` (integrates those changes into your local branch). This command is essential for keeping your local repository in sync with remote changes made by other collaborators.

## Options

### **--rebase**

Pull changes and rebase your local commits on top of the fetched changes instead of merging

```console
$ git pull --rebase origin main
From github.com:user/repo
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/main.
```

### **--ff-only**

Only fast-forward the current branch to the fetched branch

```console
$ git pull --ff-only origin main
Updating 1a2b3c4..5d6e7f8
Fast-forward
 README.md | 10 ++++++++--
 1 file changed, 8 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

### **--no-commit**

Fetch and merge but don't automatically commit the merge result

```console
$ git pull --no-commit origin feature
From github.com:user/repo
 * branch            feature    -> FETCH_HEAD
Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested
```

### **-v, --verbose**

Show more detailed information about the pull operation

```console
$ git pull -v origin main
From github.com:user/repo
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating 1a2b3c4..5d6e7f8
Fast-forward
 README.md | 10 ++++++++--
 1 file changed, 8 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Pull from Remote

```console
$ git pull
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 285 bytes | 95.00 KiB/s, done.
From github.com:user/repo
   a1b2c3d..e4f5g6h  main     -> origin/main
Updating a1b2c3d..e4f5g6h
Fast-forward
 README.md | 3 ++-
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

### Pull from Specific Remote and Branch

```console
$ git pull upstream develop
From github.com:upstream/repo
 * branch            develop    -> FETCH_HEAD
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 src/main.js | 25 +++++++++++++++++++++++++
 1 file changed, 25 insertions(+)
```

## Tips

### Avoid Merge Conflicts

Always commit or stash your local changes before pulling to avoid merge conflicts. If you have uncommitted changes that conflict with incoming changes, Git will prevent the pull operation.

### Use --rebase for Cleaner History

Using `git pull --rebase` creates a cleaner, more linear commit history by placing your local commits on top of the remote commits instead of creating a merge commit.

### Check Remote Changes Before Pulling

Run `git fetch` followed by `git log HEAD..origin/branch` to see what changes will be pulled before actually pulling them. This helps you understand what you're about to integrate.

### Pull with Specific Strategy

For complex merges, you can specify a merge strategy: `git pull --strategy=recursive -X patience` uses the patience algorithm which often produces cleaner merges for certain types of changes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q1. What's the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?
A. `git fetch` only downloads remote changes without integrating them, while `git pull` both downloads and integrates changes into your local branch.

#### Q2. How do I undo a git pull?
A. You can use `git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD` to return to the state before the pull if you haven't made additional changes.

#### Q3. Why does git pull sometimes create merge conflicts?
A. Conflicts occur when the same part of a file has been modified differently in both the remote and local repositories. Git can't automatically determine which changes to keep.

#### Q4. Can I pull from a specific commit?
A. Yes, use `git pull origin branch-name:commit-hash` to pull up to a specific commit.

#### Q5. How do I pull without merging?
A. Use `git fetch` instead of `git pull` to download changes without merging them.
