It deletes the group entry from the system group database (/etc/group and /etc/gshadow). The command requires root privileges or sudo access to execute.\n\n## Options\n\n### **-f, --force**\n\nForce removal of the group even if it is the primary group of a user.\n\n```console\n$ sudo groupdel -f developers\n```\n\n### **-h, --help**\n\nDisplay help message and exit.\n\n```console\n$ groupdel --help\nUsage: groupdel [options] GROUP\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help                    display this help message and exit\n  -R, --root CHROOT_DIR         directory to chroot into\n  -P, --prefix PREFIX_DIR       prefix directory where are located the /etc/* files\n  -f, --force                   delete group even if it is the primary group of a user\n\n```\n\n### **-R, --root CHROOT_DIR**\n\nApply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR directory.\n\n```console\n$ sudo groupdel --root /mnt/system developers\n```\n\n### **-P, --prefix PREFIX_DIR**\n\nPrefix directory where the /etc/* files are located.\n\n```console\n$ sudo groupdel --prefix /mnt/etc developers\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Deleting a group\n\n```console\n$ sudo groupdel developers\n```\n\n### Forcibly deleting a group that is a primary group for some users\n\n```console\n$ sudo groupdel -f developers\n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Check Group Dependencies Before Deletion\n\nBefore deleting a group, check if any users have it as their primary group using `grep \"^groupname:\" /etc/passwd`. If users depend on the group, you might want to change their primary group first.\n\n### Backup Group Information\n\nConsider backing up your group information before making changes:\n\n```console\n$ sudo cp /etc/group /etc/group.bak\n$ sudo cp /etc/gshadow /etc/gshadow.bak\n```\n\n### Verify Group Deletion\n\nAfter deleting a group, verify it's gone by checking the group database:\n\n```console\n$ getent group groupname\n```\n\nIf no output appears, the group was successfully deleted.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. Can I delete a group that is the primary group of a user?\nA. Yes, but you must use the `-f` or `--force` option. However, this may cause issues for those users.\n\n#### Q2. What happens to files owned by a deleted group?\nA. Files previously owned by the deleted group will still exist but will display the group ID number instead of a group name when you list them with `ls -l`.\n\n#### Q3. Do I need special permissions to delete a group?\nA. Yes, you need root privileges or sudo access to delete groups from the system.\n\n#### Q4. Can I recover a group after deleting it?\nA. No, once deleted, you would need to recreate the group manually with the same GID if you want to restore it.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/groupdel.8.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
