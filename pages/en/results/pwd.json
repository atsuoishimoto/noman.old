This helps you understand your location within the filesystem hierarchy, which is especially useful when navigating between directories or writing scripts that need to reference the current location.\n\n## Options\n\n### **-L, --logical**\n\nPrint the logical current working directory, with symbolic links in the path resolved as encountered (default behavior).\n\n```console\n$ pwd -L\n/home/user/projects\n```\n\n### **-P, --physical**\n\nPrint the physical current working directory, with all symbolic links resolved.\n\n```console\n$ pwd -P\n/var/www/html/projects\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Basic usage\n\n```console\n$ pwd\n/home/user/documents\n```\n\n### Using pwd in scripts\n\n```console\n$ echo \"Current directory: $(pwd)\"\nCurrent directory: /home/user/documents\n```\n\n### Comparing logical vs physical paths\n\n```console\n$ cd /home/user/symlink_to_projects\n$ pwd -L\n/home/user/symlink_to_projects\n$ pwd -P\n/home/user/actual/projects\n```\n\n## Tips:\n\n### Use in Shell Scripts\n\nStore the current directory in a variable to reference it later in your script:\n```bash\nCURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)\ncd /some/other/directory\n# Do some work\ncd \"$CURRENT_DIR\"  # Return to original directory\n```\n\n### Avoid Hardcoding Paths\n\nInstead of hardcoding paths in scripts, use `pwd` to make scripts more portable across different systems.\n\n### Troubleshooting Symbolic Links\n\nWhen working with symbolic links, use `pwd -P` to see where files are actually stored on disk, which can help troubleshoot permission issues.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What is the difference between `pwd` and `echo $PWD`?\nA. They typically show the same result, but `$PWD` is an environment variable that stores the current directory path. `pwd` is a command that actively determines the current directory.\n\n#### Q2. Why might `pwd -P` and `pwd -L` show different results?\nA. They differ when your current directory contains symbolic links. `-L` shows the path with symbolic links intact, while `-P` resolves all symbolic links to show the actual physical path.\n\n#### Q3. Does `pwd` work the same on all Unix-like systems?\nA. The basic functionality is the same, but there might be slight differences in available options between GNU/Linux, macOS, and other Unix variants.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/pwd-invocation.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
