If no user is specified, it displays the groups for the current user. This command is useful for checking group memberships for permission-related issues.\n\n## Options\n\nThe `groups` command has minimal options as it's designed for a simple purpose.\n\n### No options (default usage)\n\nShows the groups for the current user.\n\n```console\n$ groups\nstaff wheel admin\n```\n\n### Specify username\n\nShows the groups for the specified user.\n\n```console\n$ groups username\nusername : staff wheel admin\n```\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Checking your own group memberships\n\n```console\n$ groups\nuser wheel admin staff\n```\n\n### Checking another user's group memberships\n\n```console\n$ groups root\nroot : wheel admin system\n```\n\n### Checking multiple users' group memberships\n\n```console\n$ groups user1 user2\nuser1 : staff wheel\nuser2 : staff admin\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n### Understanding Group Membership Importance\n\nGroup memberships determine what files and resources a user can access. For example, users in the \"wheel\" group often have sudo privileges, while those in \"admin\" can perform administrative tasks.\n\n### Combining with Other Commands\n\nUse `groups` with `id` for more comprehensive user information:\n\n```console\n$ id\nuid=501(user) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts)\n```\n\n### Checking Primary Group\n\nThe first group listed is usually the user's primary group, which is used by default when creating new files.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Q1. What is the difference between primary and secondary groups?\nA. The primary group (also called the login group) is the default group assigned to files created by the user. Secondary groups provide additional permissions.\n\n#### Q2. How do I add a user to a group?\nA. Use `sudo usermod -aG groupname username` on Linux or `sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a username -t user groupname` on macOS.\n\n#### Q3. Why do I need to know my group memberships?\nA. Group memberships determine what files and resources you can access. Troubleshooting permission issues often involves checking group memberships.\n\n#### Q4. Can I see all groups on the system?\nA. Yes, use the `getent group` command on Linux or `dscl . list /Groups` on macOS to see all groups.\n\n## References\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/groups-invocation.html\n\n## Revisions\n\n- 2025/05/05 First revision",
